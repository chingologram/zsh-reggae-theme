# zsh-reggae-theme

The idea of this theme is to contain a lot of info in a small string, by
compressing some parts and colorcoding, which bring useful visual cues,
while limiting the amount of colors and such to keep it easy on the eyes.

When a command exited >0, the timestamp will be in red and the exit code
will be on the right edge.

The exit code visual cues will only display once.
(i.e. they will be reset, even if you hit enter a few times on empty command prompts)

The prompt also shows no. of commits to pull/push from origin
